Functions for reading and analysing your content on 750words.com

Read data in
------------

To read data from your downloads folder (DEFAULT_PATH set in this file)::

    >>> text, entries = read_local_750words()

Or to download directly from 750words.com::

    >>> text, entries = download_750words()

if you have PyQt4/wxPython installed a login dialog will appear, otherwise you
can log in via a shell or pass email='...' and password='...' arguments to the
function directly. This function will, by default, only download the current
month's writing, and save the exported data to disk to avoid unnecessary load on
750words.com servers. This function requires the third-party Python packages
requests, lxml, and pyquery to be installed. How to do this depends on what
kind of Python installation you have, and is beyond the scope of this README.

See the docstrings of these functions for more information, and please use
``read_local_750words()`` whenever possible.

Statistics
----------

Statistics are calculated from the *entries* list via three classes::

    >>> s750 = stats_750(entries)       # Streaks, etc.
    >>> all = stats(text)               # Text statistics on all your writing
    >>> estats = entrystats(entries)    # Text statistics per entry

Use ``print`` to explore the results of these classes, and take a look at their
docstrings and methods. I'm going to add more stats, obviously, as I get time.

The stats on the 750words.com website are -- and will probably continue to be --
far better. I made this framework mainly so I could look at how whatever
measures I can find change over time, something the 750words.com site doesn't
quite do at the moment (Feb 2013).
